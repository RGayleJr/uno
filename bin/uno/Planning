108 Cards Total (4 colors - Red, Blue, Green, Yellow) :
    76 Number Cards :
        Per Color :
            One 0
            Two of 1-9
    24 Action Cards :
        Per Color :
            Two Draw2
            Two Reverse
            Two Skip
    8 Wild cards :
        4 Wild
        4 Draw4
        
Create Card interface :
    getColor() - Should be optional type because Wild and Draw4 will need colors assigned to them
        Color options : Red, Blue, Green, Yellow
    getValue()
        Value options : 0-9, Draw2, Reverse, Skip, Wild, Draw4
    setColor() - Should only work if color is not already set; essentially making colors immutable once chosen
